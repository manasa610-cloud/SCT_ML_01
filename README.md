This project is my solution for the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques".

# Overview

The goal is to predict the sale price of houses based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more, using the Ames Housing dataset.

# Whatâ€™s Inside

- A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) with all code for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and predictions.
- A sample submission file (`submission.csv`) with the predicted house prices.
- This README file explaining the project.

# How to Run

1. Install Python and required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook or `.py` script.
3. The code loads the data, cleans it, trains a linear regression model, and makes predictions.
4. You can modify or extend the code as needed.
 or 
1. using Kaggle notebook.

# Results

- The model predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy.
- Predicted prices generally range between $35,000 and $750,000.
- Evaluation metrics and model details are included in the notebook.
